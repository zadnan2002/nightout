# nightout
On this project we built a react-web app that allows users to find a suitable event and reserve tickets. Venues can also sign up to create events and manage tickets while portal admins get to approve/reject events when an application is submitted. An archive is also available to store the history of previous events. The project utilizes an SQL based database to store data.
To start the project:

-run "nightout" using NPM START

-run "nightout_backend" using "nodemon"

-make sure to have the database server running so that the app can properly function
